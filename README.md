## About this project

I'm starting this project to learn the ins and outs of Inertia.js. Really liked how it works, and I'm sad that it took me too much time to get into it. This project will be a basic CRUD system with authentication and authorization. So far for this project I'm using:

[Laravel](https://laravel.com);  
[Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) (obviously);  
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com);  
[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org);  
[Sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/);  
[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) and  
[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com)

I'm also using Breeze's starter kit to ease the initial setup and to learn from it a bit too. I hope to improve my coding skills by the end of this project.
